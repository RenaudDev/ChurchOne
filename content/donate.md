## Ways to donate

#### Pre-Authorized Debit (PAD): 

<u>Download your copy below</u>. As we try to build a base of regular contributions, one of the best ways to do this is through the PAD agreement (page 2). It incurs less banking fees than credit card giving and gives us a better picture of what's coming in month-to-month. Email a copy to [sreynolds@anglicannetwork.ca](mailto:sreynolds@anglicannetwork.ca). 

#### Cheques: 
Made out to the Anglican Network in Canada for “Saint-Lazare.” Mail to

Anglican Network in Canada
Box 1013, Burlington, ON, 
Canada, L7R 4L8

#### Canada Helps: 
Online donation with your credit card.
