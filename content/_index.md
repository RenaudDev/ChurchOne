vision_heading1: "To See The Good News of Jesus Reach and Renew Saint-Lazare."
vision_text1: "<p>Many Quebecers have experienced Christianity and the Church in a very broken and distorted way. An increasing number of others haven’t experienced Christianity and the Church at all. For the majority of Quebecers, the beauty, truth, and goodness of Jesus’ life and death on the cross are yet to be discovered. As expressed through Quebec’s brilliant artists, singers, and poets, the hearts of Quebecers continue to search for meaning and purpose, and only Jesus will fulfill these longings.  For this reason, we hope to see the good news of Jesus reach and renew Saint-Lazare and the rest of Quebec, to the glory of God and to the flourishing of people!</p>
<p>Saint-Lazare Bible Church will seek to be an authentic, humble, and loving Christian fellowship existing for and pointing to Jesus and the Gospel. We will be a place where you grow in your faith, connect with a diverse group of God’s people, and reach out to the community in meaningful ways. </p>
<p>A small group of local Christians have already been meeting to pray for the Holy Spirit to be poured out on Saint-Lazare, Hudson, and Rigaud. We believe God is beginning to answer these prayers!</p>

values: "We are part of a worldwide Gospel-renewal movement within the Anglican communion. Anglican worship is designed to saturate people in the truth and implications of the good news of Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection. Our sincere hope is to make disciples of Jesus who’s lives flow out of a deep, heart-felt conviction of Jesus’ sacrificial love and sovereign lordship, walking in the fruits and renewal of the Holy Spirit, to the glory and pleasure of God the Father."
