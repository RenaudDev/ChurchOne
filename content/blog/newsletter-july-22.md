#### From the desk of Jonathan Camiré
  
#### Greetings!

\
I am excited to tell you Jesus lives and reigns with God the Father and the Holy Spirit!\
\
Of course you won’t hear this in the mainstream media, but it is true nonetheless. This truth has a number of implications but the most pressing for this newsletter is that the Triune God is still reconciling the world to himself. This is why we are church planting in the middle of a pandemic. In fact, it may be the best time to plant a church in our post-Christian Canadian culture as many people are asking big questions about death, meaning, love, suffering, and more.\
\
This is precisely when the church needs to be nurtured and be present to show the hope we have in Christ. There is no truth more essential than those which tell of God’s grace in Jesus for you and me. As I prepare to move my family to Quebec, we rejoice in the Lord’s answering of prayers, which many of you have prayed on our behalf!\
\
With humble gratitude, I am reminded of Romans 8:32: “He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all—how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things?”\
\
For example, the Lord provided a home for us (with many evidences of his sovereignty), my ordination to the presbyterate, and the launch of the fundraising campaign at Church of the Messiah in Ottawa. We are looking forward to many exciting developments with the church plant, a fun online VBS in August, and meeting you once we are in Quebec!\
\
I look forward to sharing more details with you in the next newsletter!\
\
For now, **please pray for our move into the new home and for a safe arrival of our second child** who is expected to be born at any moment!\
\
Blessings,\
Jonathan Camiré\
